# EventAndReservationManagment
The purpose of this project is mainly academic. I've written all the code . The work is not finished because it's a group work and I've lost the complete version of it . I only have the part that I did which is the event management and reservation. 
## Installation
1. First of all [download wampserver](http://www.wampserver.com/en/download-wampserver-64bits/) 
2. Copy the relative path to your php.exe file after you have accomplished the installation (example : C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.6.31)
3. Go to Control Panel->System->Advanced System Settings->environment variables
4. Choose Path and then add  the relative path of the php.exe you copied  (example : C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.6.31)
5. Go to CMD and try the command php-v

```bash
php -v
```
6.check on the [usual symfony reuirements](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements.html) 
7. I can help with the demos :D
## Usage 
1. Copy the project EventPi and put in this path C:\wamp64\www
2. Open CMD in that project
3.


```bash
$ symfony serve

```

If you don't have the Symfony client installed, run php bin/console server:run. Alternatively, you can configure a [web server](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html)  like Nginx or Apache to run the application.

## Contributing 
I have used API in the SyrineMobile Project and external bundles for authentification such as [FOS user](https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/FOSUserBundle/index.html)   and [SwiftMailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/swiftmailer.html)  to notify the user and confirm the reservation for the event
